!try fix it:
- as you see we have two folders "Ammo" i think it s not good, i just pressed button import(when i get warning message again) and this folder is dublicated, but it's danger to just delete/
/because i tried delete Ammo(a little earlier) and after this i lost opportunity to restore Ammo... how i understand Ammo required for rigitbody/collisions
!

- in first version of engine(in main) i moved objects with changing position( and tried catch collision) but after i make new brunch with impulses and it works, even without catching collision( how i understand it is automatic future in rigit body) 

- change names A & B to Player and PC , and change scriptname movement to MovementPlayer

- conceptual ideas about theme:
    - after win level up and levels changes from up to down( i mean illusion about going up )
    - player after succesfull punches grow up like a monster

-in "add ui logic" i changed: level to hard, and change some logic of game(reset power when hard changing)


-some ideas for submission text:
    arrow keys - moving, A,D - rotating, S - punch
