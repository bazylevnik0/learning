I heard something about Web 3.0 but Wikipedia not have current answer for this termin.
Maybe in this project it will be good thinking about it...

For me next web is understanding web like a life organism like a system of person, app and sites - live.
And maybe something about storing generating content for make unique session, maybe decentralisation

- app - like a human, have bag, passport, phone, he/she can work, travel
- maybe app is frontend

- blocks like a server, storage
- blockchain is a growing list of records(blocks), timestamps
