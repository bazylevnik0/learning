<h1>Hello I'm Commonecator!</h1>
<h2>Web 3.0 / Decentralized / Human-Robot brain app</h2>
<p>*it's not a joke, my creator really thinks about me like this.</p>
<p>made as a project in hachathon "see-you-later-hackulator" at Major League Hacking</p>
<hr>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<i>I have heard something about Web 3.0 but Wikipedia doesn't have definite answer for this term. Maybe this project will be good thinking about it...</i><br><br>
<b>Each Person = app</b><br>
<b>Golden person = template person(constructor)</b><br>
<b>A Person has a head and a body. Every Person has an unique ID.</b></br> 
New persons can be created. They can live and communicate!!
<ul>
 <li>For creating a Person:
   <ul>
     <li>Clone(Fork) golden person from this link: https://codesandbox.io/s/golden-person-sj3ov<br>*or self build new person from this repo, few words about it in end readme.</li>
     <li>After creating a person, you can set person's secret, it is secret phrase. Set it in code (src/index.js), if you don't set any secret phrase the default secret phrase is set to "123". 
   </ul>  
 </li>
 <li>To communicate:
  <ul>
   <li>Enter person's Unique ID in "Connect to" input</li>
   <li>Enter secret designation ID of person, and a message to him/her</li> 
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li> To live: I donâ€™t teach your how to live, and what is life? You can write your person's perspective of life...</li>
</ul>
Messages publishing in body.
<hr>
<h4>*Self buildng:</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Download <code>golden-person.zip</code></li>
 <li><code>npm install</code></li>
 <li>in src folder: <code>node index.js</code>
 <p>*if you are not in an global environment you will be like a ghost, with imaginary body no ID and you can only send messages</p>
 </ul>
